               <h1>Core Components Of Web Technology:</h1> 

                 To fully understand what is web technology,<br>
                 it’s essential to break down the core components that make up the modern web:<br>

                  1.HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the foundational markup language of the web.<br>
                    It defines the structure of web pages by specifying elements such as headings, paragraphs,<br>
                    lists, images, and links. HTML acts as the starting point for any website or web application.<br>

                  2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): While HTML defines the structure, CSS is responsible for the appearance.<br>
                    It controls the design, including colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness, ensuring that websites<br>
                    look good across various devices and screen sizes.<br>

                  3.JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to websites.<br>
                    It enables dynamic content, such as clickable buttons, animations, and real-time form validation.<br>
                    JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS to create seamless user experiences.<br>

                  4.Web Browsers: Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari interpret HTML, CSS,<br>
                   and JavaScript and render websites on users’ devices. They play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth<br>
                   user experience.<br>
                
                  5.Web Servers: Web servers host websites and serve content over the internet. They store files and<br>
                    data that make up a website and deliver them to users when requested. Web servers use protocols like<br>
                    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) to communicate with browsers.<br>

                  6.Web Protocols: Protocols are the rules that govern communication between web servers and browsers.<br>
                    HTTP is the most common protocol, but HTTPS, which encrypts data for security, is becoming more prevalent.<br>
                    Newer protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offer faster and more efficient communication.<br>

                  7.APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs are essential for modern web applications.<br>
                    They allow different software systems to communicate with each other. For example, a weather website<br>
                    may use an API to fetch real-time data from a third-party weather service.<br>
